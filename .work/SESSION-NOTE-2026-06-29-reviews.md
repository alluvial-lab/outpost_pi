# Session note — 2026-06-29 — bold-refactor review pass

**UPDATE 2026-06-29 (later):** The cockpit env blocker described below is now
**RESOLVED**. pub.dev became reachable (200), and a writable pub cache was
materialized at `/tmp/pi-pub-cache` via `PUB_CACHE=/tmp/pi-pub-cache
HOME=/tmp/pi-dart-home /tmp/flutter-writable/bin/flutter pub get` from
`cockpit/`. `cockpit/.dart_tool/package_config.json` now exists. `flutter
analyze` (full project) is green: "No issues found!". The two pending cockpit
verifications were run:
- `workspace-document-step-3` — 9 targeted tests pass; the static-only
  approval is now backed by a green run. Stays `done`.
- `settings-split-step-3` — the one committed test passes but is still only
  import coverage; the bounce stands on its merits (AC needs fake VM/gateway
  coverage). Stays `implementing`.
The "Fix options" section below is now historical; keep it only as a record of
what was wrong. Resume from "Resume instructions" item 3 (the 8 bounces), not
the env work.

Transient handoff note. Per `.agents/rules/agent-discipline.md` this lives in
`.work/` (transient) and is NOT a durable artifact. When the work it describes
is fully resolved, delete this file; do not link durable docs at it.

## What happened this session

Drained the entire `stage: review` backlog for the bold-refactor campaign.
11 stories reviewed as fresh-context `openai-codex/gpt-5.5` subagents (cross-model
advisory: different model class from the umans orchestrator). Review contract
established from prior-session commits: approve → `review`→`done` + `## Review`
block; bounce → `review`→`implementing` + `## Review bounce` block; commit message
`review: <slug> (<approve|approve with comments|request changes>)`.

### Verdicts

**Approved → done (3):**
- `relay-typed-actor-control-handlers-step-3` (`f38f244`) — `SubscriptionIndex`
  dedup; relay fmt/clippy/test green.
- `canonical-session-relay-opaque-targeting-step-3` (`6af2865`) — opaque
  `to_room`/`session_id` forwarding; relay full suite green.
- `cockpit-workspace-projection-workspace-document-step-3` (`4b315f5`) — typed
  command transforms, real-state tests. ⚠️ Flutter verification NOT actually
  run — see env block below. Weakest of the three approvals.

**Bounced → implementing (8):**
- `canonical-session-identity-model-step-4` (`21448e1`) — relay still owns
  `session_id` room metadata; missing-room defaults to `main` (fail-closed AC).
- `transcript-event-log-store-step-1` (`a60767c`) — **reproduced locally**:
  `PathNotFoundException` at `app/lib/data/local/boxes.dart:69` for peer ids with
  `/` (Hive path-safety bug). Dedup/isolation tests can't run. Real fail-fast
  boundary violation.
- `canonical-session-wire-discriminator-step-3` (`1f78e17`) — **phantom
  implement**: only the story file changed, no code.
- `cockpit-settings-split-step-3` (`1dc89eb`) — test is import/instantiation
  only; AC requires fake-VM/gateway coverage.
- `generated-protocol-dart-codegen-step-2` (`5115cb5`) — regenerated
  `protocol.g.dart` ≠ committed file.
- `generated-protocol-rust-codegen-step-2` (`e8bed24`) — changes missing-room
  behavior (reject→default `main`); not a pure `[refactor]`.
- `split-pi-extension-index-composition-root-step-3` (`a1201e5`) — `legacy_ports.ts`
  defines adapters but `index.ts` never wires them.
- `transcript-event-log-projection-derive-step-3` (`5e259a8`) — prior bounce
  addressed, but 7 sync-service failures remain (stale projection resurrects
  cleared rows).

### Stage delta

`done` 41 → 44 · `review` 11 → 0 · `implementing` 84 → 92 · `drafting` 4

## Env blocker (the thing to resolve) — cockpit verification impossible

**Symptom:** `flutter analyze`/`flutter test` cannot run for `cockpit/`.
Reviewers hit read-only `/opt/flutter/bin/cache` and `pub get` fails (403).

**Verified root cause (three independent blocks):**
1. `cockpit/.dart_tool/` does not exist — deps never resolved here.
   (`pubspec.lock` IS committed, so versions are pinned — good.)
2. pub.dev is firewalled: every proxy (`:3128`, `:1080`, `:8082`) returns
   403/refused for `pub.dev`; DNS for `pub.dev` and `pub.flutter-io.cn` does not
   resolve without proxy. **github.com IS reachable (200).**
3. `/home/agent/.pub-cache/` is read-only AND missing cockpit's heavy deps
   (`shadcn_flutter`, `flutter_modular`, `file_picker`,
   `flutter_local_notifications`, `media_kit`, `xterm`, `window_manager`).
   Has 189 packages (enough for `app/`, which works because it's already
   resolved into `app/.dart_tool/`).

**Why app/ works but cockpit/ doesn't:** app's dep set is lighter (no
shadcn/modular/native plugins) and was already resolved in a prior session.

### Fix options (ranked by effort, low→high)
- **A — One network window to pub.dev.** With pub.dev reachable, run once:
  `cd cockpit && PUB_CACHE=<writable-dir> HOME=/tmp/pi-dart-home /tmp/flutter-writable/bin/flutter pub get`
  then offline `analyze`/`test` work indefinitely. This is what the prior
  session did for `app/`.
- **C — Copy resolved deps from another machine.** If cockpit builds locally
  elsewhere, `rsync` that machine's `cockpit/.dart_tool/` + the matching
  `~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/{shadcn_flutter-*,...}` subtrees into the
  sandbox. Zero network. ~30s. Fastest if the machine exists.
- **B — Git-mirror missing packages.** github is up, but `shadcn_flutter 0.0.52`,
  `media_kit`, `xterm` are published-only or have transitive hosted deps not on
  github. Fragile, mutates pubspec. Not recommended.
- **D — Accept env limit, harden review contract.** Lower-confidence review lane
  for cockpit with explicit "verify on real machine" gate before trust/release.
  This is what prior session did (approve-with-comments + env-block note).

**Working flutter for the sandbox:** `/tmp/flutter-writable/bin/flutter` with
`HOME=/tmp/pi-dart-home` (used by app/ reviews; writable cache at
`/tmp/flutter-writable/bin/cache`). PUB_CACHE must point somewhere writable.

## Resume instructions

When dev env is resolved, the immediate next moves:
1. Re-verify `cockpit-workspace-projection-workspace-document-step-3` (`4b315f5`)
   with real `flutter analyze` + `flutter test`. If it passes, keep it `done`;
   if not, bounce it back. It currently rests on static-only approval.
2. Re-verify `cockpit-settings-split-step-3` (`1dc89eb`) AC: does any existing
   test cover fake-VM/gateway load/save/disposal, or is the bounce correct that
   only import/instantiation coverage was added?
3. Resume autopilot draining of the 92 `implementing` stories — but prioritize
   the 8 bounced stories above (especially transcript-store path-safety, which
   is small and I've already located at `boxes.dart:69`).

**Untracked `.key`/`.pem` in the working tree are local secrets — leave them
untracked, do NOT commit.**

## Aside: phantom-implement signal

3 of 8 bounces (wire-discriminator-step-3, rust-codegen-step-2,
composition-root-step-3) are "phantom implement" or "non-pure-refactor"
findings — the implement pass advanced steps on insufficient work. Worth a
look at whether the implement orchestrator was verifying acceptance criteria
before advancing to review, separate from any review-harshness question.
